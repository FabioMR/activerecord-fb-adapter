# ActiveRecord Firebird Adapter

This is the ActiveRecord adapter for working with the Firebird SQL Server

# About

# Changelog


Although this adapter may not yet have feature parity with the 1st tier databases supported by the Rails developers,
it has been in production for several months without issues and may be considered stable.

Thanks to the community for the Rails 4 patches. Superficial testing shows it to be working.
